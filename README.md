# Nutrition-XR

The ultimate idea is to inform the general public about nutrition. Our goal is to create a VR and AR application that will allow users to be introduced to the various food groups, learn more about what they eat and thus adopt healthier ways of meal planning through interactive games. The VR application will allow the user to prepare meals while informing them about the nutritional value of they have prepared. The AR application will allow the user to compare portion sizes and receive real time feedback about the food with nutritional information. We want the user to be more aware of the nutritional value of food. This application will also create a way for the user to experiment with meals to create a healthy meal plan.

For the VR -- we need to use VR to create an environment where the users can create the food of their choice. They would not need to physically make their food in their kitchen; the wait time and cost of the ingredients does not exist. Also, by using VR, the users have visual aid of how big the portions are, rather than stating that a plate of spaghetti is x amount of calories and carbs, etc.

For the AR -- it will use AR and machine learning to detect what food you have presented. By using AR technology, the application can show the approximated healthy portion sizes compared to what the users have presented. By using machine learning algorithm, the camera/picture will recognize the food on the plate, and AR can be used as said above. AR could also be able to present the nutrition value of the said food without the users having the need to look up online/food database. 

Ultimately, both VR and AR are visual aids for users to be informed, learning more about nutrition and about their diets.
