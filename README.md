# Nutrition-VR

The ultimate idea is to inform the general public about nutrition. Our goal is to create a VR application that will allow users to be introduced to the various food groups, learn more about what they eat and thus adopt healthier ways of meal planning through interactive games. The VR application will allow the user to prepare meals while informing them about the nutritional value of they have prepared. We want the user to be more aware of the nutritional value of food. This application will also create a way for the user to experiment with meals to create a healthy meal plan.

For the VR -- we need to use VR to create an environment where the users can create the food of their choice. They would not need to physically make their food in their kitchen; the wait time and cost of the ingredients does not exist. Also, by using VR, the users have visual aid of how big the portions are, rather than stating that a plate of spaghetti is x amount of calories and carbs, etc.

Ultimately, we want to use VR as a visual aid for users to be informed, learning more about nutrition and about their diets.
